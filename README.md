Hello. This repository mainly includes the codes for our website that is meant to improve and enhance the time management, studying efficiency, and overall academic performances of students.
If you wish to add more ideas or contents to the code itself to further improve the website itself, you may do so by switching to editor mode. Take note that only add the necessary which will be used to improve the website, again.
We're going to need a lot of HTML files. Here are the following necessary files: about.html, homeworks.html, pomodoro.html, relax.html, quizzes.html, flashcard.html, compete.html, and contact.html. Also, all of the styles used in each html file will only be coded in one single css file named style.css which is already in the repository. Same goes for the 
JavaScript codes.
